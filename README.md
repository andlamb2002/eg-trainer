# EGTrainer App
https://andlamb2002.github.io/eg-trainer/

My name is Andreas Lambropoulos and this is my personal project designed as a 2x2 training tool. Inspired by [ZBLL Trainer](https://bestsiteever.ru/zbll), this application's goal is to help speedcubers (including myself) with recognition and execution of EG cases and practice for one-looking.
