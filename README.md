# EGTrainer App
https://andlamb2002.github.io/eg-trainer/

My name is Andreas Lambropoulos and this is my personal project designed as a 2x2 training tool. Inspired by [ZBLL Trainer](https://bestsiteever.ru/zbll), this application's goal is to help speedcubers (including myself) with recognition and execution of EG cases and practice for one-looking.

## Tech Stack
- **React Frontend**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **LocalStorage**

## Current Features
- **Case Toggles**: Ability to toggle specific CLL/EG1 cases.
- **Scramble Generation**: Randomly selected scramble based on toggled cases.
- **Timer**: Spacebar to start/stop the timer.
- **Time List**: Solves recorded in time list, as well as solve count and mean.
- **Solve Info**: Provided scramble, case, and time of previous solves.
- **Presets**: Name and save presets of specific cases.

## Future Implemntations
- **Add Face**: Apply 0-5 move face before EG case. Designed for one-look practice.
- **Case Images**: Visuals to appear in case toggles and solve info.
- **EG2 and Solved Face Cases**: Scrambles options for these cases.
- **Settings**: Options for font size, color, timer, etc.
- **Keyboard Shortctus**: For deleting solves, navigation, etc.
- **Overall Design/Layout**: Redesign of entire app.
